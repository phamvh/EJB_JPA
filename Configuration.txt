To create a module or project that contains both an EJB and a JPA Entity we should add an "EJB:Java Enterprise Beans" and a "JavaEE Persistence‚Äù framework to the existing module.
In both the frameworks, the "Download" option under "Libraries" should be chosen. 
This way, the necessary external libraries (JPA 2.0 and EJB 3.2) will be download automatically and will be included into the classpath.

When adding a "JavaEE Persistence" framework, we need also to specify a Persistence provider. A Persistence Provider does the actual implementation of the JPA.
Some Persistence Providers are: Hibernate, EclipseLink,OpenGL, etc. Hibernate is the most popular one and is the one recommended to be used.

Another point to keep in mind when using JPAs is the need to set up a Persistence Unit, which basically consists of one or more Entity (JPA) beans along with the properties of the Persistence Provider that would be applied to those beans.
The Persistence units are defined in the persistence.xml file found under the META_INF folder (created by the JavaEE Persistence framework).
